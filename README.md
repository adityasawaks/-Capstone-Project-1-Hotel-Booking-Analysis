##  Summary of Capstone project and its components

The hotel sector is very unpredictable and bookings depend on a wide range of variables,
including hotel type, seasonality, day of the week, and many more. To assist the hotels in making
better plans, it is now even more crucial to analyse the patterns present in the historical data. In
order to increase revenue, hotels can run a number of campaigns using past data. Using time
series, we applied the patterns to forecast upcoming reservations.

We examined the variables influencing hotel reservations using the data at our disposal.
These variables can be used to forecast upcoming reservations and report trends.

In terms of the hotel type, customer type, customer preferences and time preference, the
investigation has revealed some significant discoveries.

The hotel can make plans based on the EDA results to attract new customers in order to
boost spending and uphold positive relationships with current clients
Hotels have knowledge of guest preferences for meals and accommodations which will
improve their ability to price goods.

According to some measurements growth from 2015 to 2016 was greater than that of the
year after. We can compare the variations across years to find the exceptional performance
and match it.

There is not a particularly clear definition of new customers. A new client this year will
return the next year or they may be a repeat client as of the second booking. Based on
definition a more thorough study is necessary.

The study of booking types for weekdays and weekends can be drilled down further.
Few variables are used in the categorization model. By adding new variables and
modifying the cost of misclassification we may fine-tune the model. In order to prevent
over fitting we also need to divide the data into train and validation sets
